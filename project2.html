                <p>For my python project, I recreated the game of Nim. The two most important points to making the program of this game are 
                the while loops needed for ending the game and changing players as well as the if statements for each individual case possible 
                when playing the game. One of the biggest problems we had when making creating the code was the conditions for the if statements.
                The amount of different outcomes for the game began to be very hard to keep track of, making sure that if there was a repeating 
                problem in every condition that each one was edited correctly. Thankfully, we solved this problem by making more specific variables
                and having a more organized workspace to keep track of every line. Another problem we had when making the code was the conditions of 
                the while loops. It became very confusing on the difference of and's and or's for the conditions and what to do for each situation. We 
                fixed this problem by asking our instructor on the differences and experimenting with one while loop to see what works. Thankfully we found
                that the or statement was the correct choice for the process we needed to be executed by the code. An opportunity that I got from this project 
                was knowing the differences from and's and or's statements and the correct time to use them. As for the individual work I did for the project, 
                I was in charge of the if statement conditions and the function that was executed for each statement to make sure that two different actions did not 
                make the same outcome.</p>
